An implementation of the Nintendo Gameboy (TM) instruction set based on information in
the "Gameboy (TM) CPU Manual" and various other sources. Accurately modeling the
behaviour -- speed, operations, etc -- rather than duplicating the actual hardware
is the goal. The design centers on an 8-bit ALU and a 16-bit register file with minimal
arithmetic functionality.
